## 👋 About Me  
Hi! I'm Haodong (Jason) Hu 🌐  
📌 Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence @ HKUST(GZ) | Studentship: CS(BJUT) → FinTech(CUHK) → AI(HKUST)  
🔍 Architecting Cognitive Engines: Domain-Knowledge-Infused LLMs × Multimodal Graph Structural Learning  

⚡ Technical Signature:  
▸ Pioneering research in Graph Machine Learning: Decoding complex business ecosystems through neural topology mapping 🌀  
▸ Designing LLM Adaptation Frameworks: Specialized fine-tuning pipelines for temporal financial reasoning 📊  
▸ Cross-disciplinary edge: Algorithmic trading strategies meet explainable graph neural architectures  

🚀 Current Venture:  
"Compiling Financial Logic into Neural Operators" - Developing AlphaGen Protocol, a hybrid architecture combining LLM-based causal inference with market microstructure modeling 

🌍 Vision Statement:  
_"Reinventing quantitative finance through neuro-symbolic intelligence"_  
Advancing neural compilation techniques for domain knowledge graphs | Building convergent intelligence for alternative data streams 🔗  

🎯 Research Manifesto:  
"Every Alpha Generation Is an Act of Structured Discovery"
